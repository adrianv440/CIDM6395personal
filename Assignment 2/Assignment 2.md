# Assignment 2

## INTRO

Data Mining and management are a crucial step for businesses to track from any level. These levels include their own personnel, management, partners and finally the customers information.  As it came to understanding and utilizing Data management the two courses that assisted with my experience are CIDM 6350 and CIDM 6355. Unlike the data analytics section of the project these courses focus on building knowledge from 6350 to 6355. The intent of the courses was overall to first understand the importance and basic of data mining and management terminology, application and real-world scenario usage. Through these resources and courses there were many concepts, strategies and lessons learned. 

## WHAT DO YOU KNOW

In these courses the first understanding of data management are the concepts and terminology. Starting with CIDM 6350 a table I learned to manage and put together for numerous sets of data was the Entity relationship diagrams. These diagrams help break data that may have been related to a quick and easy find for their relationships using different kind of relationships. When it comes to managing these datasets the easiest way of handling unstructured data to structured data is through the use of DDL. This language helps with SQL functions in creating tables and breaking down the data to create tables. To manage multiple data sets and tables through SQL we had to learn more on DML which help join, alter and update your data sets into each other. Through these concepts and examples a dataset table would be easy to incorporate for the final project of the capstone. 

Once personnel understand the basic concepts and application of data management, you can move to further complex systems in CIDM 6355. The areas in this course I felt comfortable utilizing was the basic concepts of R Studio and RapidMiner for visualizations. R studio assisted with creating folders through your application and handling future predictions with this stored data. In this course I learned how to apply the R code and Rapidminer techniques while comparing the results for both applications. The greatest assets I have for my prediction models with these applications would be the decision tree models in Rapidminer. I can utilize this in both applications but have a better understanding and knowing the use for my final project in Rstudio as well.

## WHERE ARE YOU WEAK

The areas in which I am weak for these courses are specific concepts of the data language starting with CIDM 6350. I need more understanding of the shortcuts to code for SQL to shorten and make my joins through the application much faster. I also have difficulty in making the distinction between the concepts of joins such as inner join and outer join. Finally the last issue I have is understanding and identifying the keys for each dataset. If both data sets have multiple foreign keys it is difficult for me to identify the correct main foreign key. 

The area in which I am weak for in my further course of CIDM 6355 is properly utilizing some functions in this course. The first function is properly targeting in R studio the correct attribute for the logistic regression function. I found this hard in multiple areas of the course. The next function I need better understanding of is this Neural Network chart. This concept confused me on how to know which attributes to primarily focus on and at what level to get feeback on in the chart. Finally, I would like more concentration on how to utilize an elbow chart in excel. Since my company’s main tools come from Microsoft I feel as though it is easier to understand and display in my workplace environment. 

## WHAT YOU WISH YOU KNEW 

The understanding of data mining and management is critical and knowing how to utilize your information can benefit your work place. One thing I wish I knew are some alternatives from SQL since having a third party application cannot be added to my work computer. The benefits of applying these techniques would allow me to not forget basic concepts in these courses since I deal with big data at work every day. 

As it comes through R studio I would like to learn more techniques from R code. This application seemed very easy to use, and I would enjoy trying to store more data and work on other techniques to see further data visualization. These codes all showed me that you need to apply or practice what you learn to maintain your knowledge. 

## EXAMPLES OF WORK 

As shown in my examples of work, there were examples of my code utilizing my knowledge in DDL and DML. These samples came from my course in one of my spring semesters. This work came from practicing my applications in W3 school and practicing SQL. Unfortunately, there was some mistakes when it came to handling the outside join and inner join from my work to apply it properly in a project. This was a huge learning point as you see I was able to create a new table and utilize the DML models in the application stage.  

In CIDM 6355’s sample of work I took a bit from both applications of Rapid Miner and R to display some of the skills I obtained in the course. These skills were practiced through R studio code, helping make my own terminal to make examples. Through Rapidminer I was able to create my own examples of decision trees and input my data properly. 


In these applications I can utilize the advancement of Data management to help predict my prototypes tendencies and trends. This would allow me to display my work through the visualization codes in R studio. 

## CONTRIBUTIONS TOWARDS THE CAPSTONE 

Data management is critical for data analytics as this would help understand where to store and how each dataset relates to one another.  Through software systems, data management can assist in companies saving the correct system for their data management. Companies need to know where to share and store their data. Leading to the cybersecurity aspect of data management, understanding trends and vulnerability are detrimental in securing data as without data management there would be no way to know who and what companies. need to protect in their datasets.  As for the final prototype project Data management will help display the correct keys and breakdown of my large amounts of data.
