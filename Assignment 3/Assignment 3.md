# Assignment 3
## INTRO 
Systems development will lead your enterprise and company into the future as systems are now further advanced than ever before. These developments for systems can integrate multiple applications through user interfaces assisting in the development of any systems engineer. Through these courses I have learned how to enable python and other data models as a main source to create new and editable systems for a company. Prior to diving into these courses, I had very limited access to preparing and understanding how a simple code gave the possibility to create a friendly user interface for a company.

## WHAT YOU KNOW 

Through the systems development course of 6303 I learned how to utilize the basics of HTTP and CSS to assist in creating a more complex design. These basic concepts easily assist new developers understand the distinct difference between the purpose of communication of HTTP and the design of CSS. As we moved further the course there were examples set by the professor to understand and utilize python code. I understood how to install the system through terminal from MacBook but also how to utilize VScode to create a great test environment. As Python being the programmed language, I learned that Django could assist in creating a framework utilizing Python scripts. 
Through the implementation of understanding foundational concepts such as the WWW infrastructure I was able to learn a more in-depth standard of how web technologies work. This gave an insight to the development of other languages and seeing the hierarchy of programming, which I learned in CIDM 6330. The design of incorporating multiple languages through Python gave the opportunity to create an interactive design website that I still would prefer to expand my abilities on. 

## WHERE ARE YOU WEAK
The areas that I feel that I am weak are a lot of the programming languages. As I learned how to merge most of my documents through GITHUB I found that I still needed a lot more practice in the programming languages. While watching tutorials I found there are different avenues to approach utilizing Python and DJANGO for my projects from my previous courses. As I still try to use these as my Framework I feel as though the more I practice these codes the better end results I will have for my projects and assignments. 

As I feel more comfortable with HTML and CSS scripting with creating a website I feel as though I need more practice to work on my DJANGO packages to assist with the structure of the site. These packages seem to have had endless possibilities to create websites, but I feel as though I did not create a great product as shown in my examples. 

## WHAT YOU WISH YOU KNEW

As the development of information systems becomes more and more complex every day, I wish I knew more on the subject. One of the topics that always caught my attention was the presentation and understanding of Artificial Intelligence (AI). I would like to understand how to incorporate this into my understanding of systems. AI can assist the future of systems with automations and simple tasks. 

The other development I wish I knew were some of the other programming languages such as C++ to create other products. As programing advances there seems to be endless capabilities on what can be made with different languages. I wish I could further my knowledge as well on how to use Visual Studio code as it is authorized in my workplace but downloading other systems are not. If I were to understand these restrictions and limitations, I feel as though I could easily change the enterprise flow for my work.   

## EXAMPLES OF WORK

In the examples of work that follow through the repositories you will see some of the examples of creating simple tasks through Github. I utilized some of the Python script which I learned in my CIDM 6303 to help create a simple script. This became operational through the creation of a site utilized with VScode. 

In the following examples I provided some of the input from trying to create an interactive site with DJANGO framework. This unfortunately did not work as planned as I was not comfortable as much with creating automated sites outright with DJANGO and Python. IO did learn to create automation flows with Microsoft to incorporate further tasks for my workplace as well into my systems.   

## CONTRIBUTION TOWARD THE CAPSTONE

Development of information systems is critical to apply the knowledge gained and example sets made for the project. Without having the knowledge of systems, you would not understand the importance of cybersecurity to store information in. Then moving to the analytics portion you would not have the ability to pass on the information of your visualizations without the input of system controls. Finally, without systems you would not have the ability to properly manage your data without systems to properly store and automate your information. Information systems is a critical layer in business analytics.
