# INTRO

One of the leading grossing career fields in most companies must deal with cybersecurity and networking. These subjects are in the uproar of the new generation making it very important for every individual to understand basic concepts for their company to survive. As a former security analyst and a current project manager these skills are a must for any large project in my workplace environment. The skills I gained through the courses of CIDM 6340 and CIDM 6341 were imperative for me to learn. As I apply the tools of what I learned that there are many ways to detect unwanted network traffic and easily evaluate not only yourself but your company’s security policies. 

## WHAT YOU KNOW

Through the two courses of networking and cybersecurity there were many new applications that I learned to utilize to protect my network but also a smaller company’s network as well. One of the tools that I used was the NMAP tool to understand scanning vulnerabilities. This tool assisted in detection of networks for your devices. After understanding this tool, I learned about Wireshark and the live packet tracing for this application. Wireshark assisted in viewing what packets were being transmitted from your device to other networks. This help catch any of the suspicious activities of certain devices. 
In CIDM 6341 the applications that were utilized assisted with more of a system detection for the user’s information. As I utilized tools such as CCleaner, to view unnecessary documents and to assist with clean up with my system. I also used an application of Have I been PWNED for detection if my e-mails, phone numbers or communication devices have been detected for ransomware. The use of these applications assisted with the completion of both contingency plans as well as audit plans to view other small businesses. This help view risks that people may overlook.

## WHERE ARE YOU WEAK

The areas where I feel as though I am vulnerable are the specific ports for networks. As this is where utilizing your tools everyday would assist, distinction between ports and what to do once they are identified as vulnerable would assist with understanding why ports are important. This would help with why Shields up application is important to the workspace as well. 

The next area in which I feel that I need improvement on are the red hat tools. These tools such as John the Ripper, Spyrix and Prey seem to have a lot of features that I do not feel I am a subject matter expert on. These tools seem very helpful in discovering where your company may be flawed. This would assist your blue hats in the company for where your security vulnerabilities may lie. 

## WHAT YOU WISH YOU KNEW

The areas in which I wish I knew for cybersecurity would be the updates on these applications. As there are a lot of spam sites, there becomes a hard distinction on what applications can be trusted. This would help me know which sites I could use at my workplace.
The next area I wish I knew more how to use is Wireshark. This tool seems that it would have an endless possibility in finding out what ports are communicating back in forth with live packers. Once I can understand this application, I could see what packets should not be entering my local networking. Once I test it more with my local network, I can use to secure my workplaces network and the area.

## EXAMPLES OF WORK

Through my examples of work, you will notice that there are the uses of the applications with my local network and devices. These examples display the practical use of these applications including Wireshark, CCleaner, as well as NMAP tool. These devices were tools that I used to identify vulnerabilities for my plans I created.
 
The plans that I created were my security audit plan and contingency plan. Through these plans you can view what were the biggest security issues for smaller companies and myself. This displayed what would be the highest security risk whether that is software of hardware. Then moving on to the contingency plan it was built similarly to the audit plan on potential risks for a company. The difference was the outcomes of what the action plan would be to keep the company continuing operations. These tools led to these plans to be developed.

## CONTRIBTUION TOWARD THE CAPSTONE

The capstone would need to display a significant audit plan to ensure the data is kept safe from unauthorized users. Cyber security is imperative for the containment of data. This includes the hardware of data and software of data as well. The use of this can assist with resourcing the correct data to the correct security compliance. Cybersecurity also outlines how the management of data is supposed to be upheld as well. Finally, cybersecurity prevents unauthorized users in your systems you create for your company. This makes it the most vital subject to understand in information systems.
