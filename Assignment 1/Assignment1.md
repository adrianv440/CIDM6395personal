# Assignment 1

## Intro

The importance of Data Analytics is crucial for any business enterprise. This subject can be a turning point for a company to not only strive but survive.  As a learning opportunity for data analytics there were two courses that enhanced my knowledge in the subject. These 12-week courses were CIDM 5310 and CIDM 6308. Although each course focused in guiding the students through specific objectives in data analytics, they both guided users to understanding the importance of the subject in a workplace environment. The main applications users learned from these courses was the utilization of Rapid Miner from CIDM 6308 and Microsoft Power BI from CIDM 5310.

## WHAT DO YOU KNOW


As these two courses were extremely helpful in expanding a person’s knowledge in data analytics one thing, I learned from each course is the responsibility of the data manager to clean the organizations data. This step helps assess and analyze your data’s dashboards properly. The other areas in which I feel very comfortable with utilizing data analytics are transforming data through Power BI and visualizing this data. The visualization can help predict models and even utilize BI’s AI to assist with data to text responses. As I continue to provide what I feel comfortable with in my data analytics skills, I feel very comfortable with the 4V model as shown from my previous examples in my portfolio. The 4 V model consists of volume, variety, velocity and veracity. This competency is a great measure of what your data is capable of predicting and integrating with in other subjects which we will discuss in a further section. 

The next course is CIDM 6308 where our main focus was understanding and utilizing data for measurements of future predictions. I am comfortable with utilizing RapidMiner and tableau to assess and visualize data examples.  A competency that can greatly contribute to my project is the form of clustering. One issue that may come from utilizing clustering is the amount of data given to narrow down the answer in which we are seeking for our project. As these are some of the subjects that I feel more comfortable with for the final project there may be some obstacle depending on the data received for the prototype to deliver the actions of these competencies.


## WHERE ARE YOU WEAK 

The competencies for CIDM 5310 in data analytics in which I feel I am weak is the three tier diagram. Understanding breaking down of the diagram to explain the functionality properly for a project is critical for project managers and associates to easily identify where each goal for a project should be met. I had difficulty as shown in the three-tier diagram shown in assignment 0. This tier diagram could have been broken into better context for the professor to easily identify the customer layer, application layer and the database layer. 

The subjects in my data analytics 2 courses in which I feel I can still improve on is explaining the utilization of a SQL table over an excel table. As excel is an easier product for me to use I have a hard time of letting go of this function over SQL as I forget the basic functions of SQL coding to create my tables separately. I understand it is easier to store data through SQL for the database layer but a little difficult to utilize as I cannot do so in my workplace environment.

## WHAT YOU WISH YOU KNEW

The subjects I wish I knew for these courses can correlate to one another as most of these subjects were due to technical difficulties or limited time access. The first application I would like to know more of, is the implementation of BI into Azure. This function seemed very helpful for any prototype but due to money constraints, it seems difficult to incorporate into the project, as known from previous courses. The next applications are the data courses from Datacamp as these are very informative on the subject in data analytics. These courses help me understand step by step mistakes from using previous applications such as Tableau. This utilization can help my further understanding in analytics. 

In forms of competencies or subjects in which I wish I knew more of I would like to understand when to properly utilize correlation into functions in Excel. This tool can help display why some data sets can affect each other to support evidence for the data analytics process. 

## EXAMPLES OF WORK

As shown through the initial assessment from assignment 0 I have shown examples of creating visualizations from both courses in my GitHub repository. These examples display from PowerBI the utilization of six different visualizations that I created in my previous class. As for the RapidMiner example there is a display of work, I provided an example of a decision tree utilizing a root node to break down the leaf nodes. These examples came from sources provided in my courses such as Tobias’ book in the understanding of Business intelligence. Most of my source for CIDM 6308 came from Professor Chen through lectures and inquiries on questions.  

The capstone project that I will hope to create as a prototype will utilize the understanding of Churn and Power BI to display the significance for the number of returning personnel in a specific department in my workplace. This assessment of utilizing Data Analytics will be critical for the visualizations and understanding breakdowns into terms that my supervisor will understand. 

## CONTRIBUTION TOWARD THE CAPSTONE

Data Analytics is the foundation for data management, software systems and networking and cybersecurity.  Through analytics data management can easily be accessible and easier to follow in future references. Analytics in software systems can display the codes not everyone can understand through visualizations. Finally with networking and cybersecurity, company’s analytics would be vulnerable of leaks and future attacks making customers question their integrity. Analytics is a pivotal role in not only the four subject above but in our everyday lives making it easy to track current trends with a simple photo.
